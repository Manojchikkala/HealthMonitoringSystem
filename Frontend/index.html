            <h2>About Machine Learning</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that empowers
              computers to learn and improve from data without explicit programming. 
              By utilizing algorithms, these systems can identify patterns within vast datasets, 
              enabling them to make predictions, classifications, and decisions. This transformative technology is revolutionizing industries, 
              from healthcare and finance to marketing and customer service, by unlocking valuable insights and automating complex tasks.</p>
